## 

Although the first Software Engineering course I took was full of non-stop learning, the most valuable learning experiences I gained from this course surprisingly weren't related to learning new coding languages or frameworks.

I had some experience with configuration management, the process of managing a project to maintain consistensy, but had never practiced it in a way to take advantage of its full potential. Throughout the course, we've had many projects that were saved in iterations; this was especially useful for the [final project](https://kryf.github.io/projects/uhber) where previous versions of code needed to be restored to discover what had caused our app to crash. After frequently utilizing configuration management through [GitHub](https://github.com/kryf), I realized how convenient this process is and how it would save me a lot of time when I was deleting lines of code from my Android app project trying to figure out what made it crash.
