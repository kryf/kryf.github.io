Although the first Software Engineering course I took was full of non-stop learning, the most valuable learning experiences I gained from this course surprisingly weren't related to learning new coding languages or frameworks.

## The Most Difficult Part of Learning is Relearning

I had some experience with Configuration Management, the process of managing a project to maintain consistensy, but had never practiced it in a way to take advantage of its full potential. Throughout the course, we've had many projects that were saved in iterations; this was especially useful for the [final project](https://kryf.github.io/projects/uhber) where previous versions of code needed to be restored to discover what had caused our app to crash. After frequently utilizing Configuration Management through [GitHub](https://github.com/kryf), I realized how convenient and important this process is. It became abunduntly clear this is a practice I should utilize for projects even outside of the course when I considered how it would have save me a lot of time when I was deleting lines of code from my Android app project trying to figure out what made it crash.

There were also practices I thought I apply frequently, but have now realized I need to improve on, primarily Agile Project Management. Agile Project Management is an iterative project planning process, we practiced this process by using tasks within [milestones](https://github.com/UHBer/UHBer/projects) to complete our final project.
