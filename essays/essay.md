# Textbook Resell

## Overview
<i>The problem:</i> Classes require students to spend money on textbooks with no dependable buy-back opprotunity at a decent buy-back price. Tragically, there's centralized location to advertise their old textbooks to other students.

<i>The solution:</i> The application will create a centralized forum for students advertise and view other students' textbooks for sell. This can include the course it's for, condition, contact info, photos, price points.

## Approach
There are multiple user roles. The student role can be anyone with a UH id, they're allowed to make and view postings. The admin role is chosen by the site creators to monitor and filter out non-related posts. 

The site will allow users to pick a specific course, i.e. biology, chemistry; this will show textbooks related to only these courses. The site can also filter textbooks by price point and condition. 

If a user sees a post that was unrelated or a scam, they can report it via the report button on the list item page. This sends a report to the Admin. 

Mockup pages include:
Landing page
User home page
User profile page
List item page
Admin home page
Category page
Create post page
