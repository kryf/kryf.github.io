## Getting Started with ESLint
Improving your coding standards can help you create concise, organized code and can be beneficial when sharingcode with a group to allow easy comprehension. Although I believe we all subconsciously understand the importance of coding standards, writing code that adheres to such standards can be a huge pain. Even after coding for a couple years, itâ€™s difficult for me to code to the standards of ESLint.
