UHber is a website which aims to assist students organize carpools between their home cities and the UH Manoa campus. By creating a convenient platform, we hope to promote a safe environment for students to meet new friends, help ease traffic/parking congestion around the UH Manoa campus, and support the reduction of motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.
