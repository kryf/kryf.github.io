## What is UHber?
<img class="ui image" align="right" src="../images/new-landing2.PNG" height="220px" width="400px">

UHber is a website which aims to assist students organize carpools between their home cities and the UH Manoa campus. By creating a convenient platform, we hope to promote a safe environment for students to meet new friends, help ease traffic/parking congestion around the UH Manoa campus, and support the reduction of motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

## Working on UHber
Working on UHber was a unique experience to say the least. Although I've worked on a group coding projects before, I've never done web development as a group; I believe this project was more difficult to work on as a group than previous coding projects. In past projects I worked on, there were little conflicts between code or the group was small enough to easily know what changes had been made that may have caused an issue. Unlike previous projects, it was often difficult to identify the cause of an issue and changes other members made.

I was responsible for working on the landing page, navbar, and profile. Most of the navbar items were only shown when the user was logged in. We ended up changing the design of the landing page to give our website a more modern look. Although I wanted to improve the design of the user profile, the profile page is mainly a submission page which allows the user to add their information without changing their email address.

Communication played a major role in this project since so many components are interconnected, it's easy for one change to affect the entire project. I believe many of our project tasks were too broad, if we were to redo/continue this project (or when I create projects in the future) we would likely need to break tasks down to focus on a specific issue rather than have a task be working on one component of the website.
